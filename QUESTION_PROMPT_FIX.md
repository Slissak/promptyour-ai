# Question Prompt Fix Documentation

## 🐛 Issue Fixed

**Problem**: Users had to write their question twice when using the terminal chat
- Initial prompt showed: `> :`
- Then customization mode asked: `💭 Your question:`
- This created confusion and poor user experience

## ✅ Solution Implemented

Changed the main chat prompt to be consistent with the customization flow.

### Before (Problem)
```
💡 Type /help for commands, or start chatting!

> Hello, what is AI?                    ← User types question here
                                        ← Then in Enhanced mode...

──────────────────────────────────────
💭 Your question: Hello, what is AI?   ← User has to type AGAIN!
```

### After (Fixed)
```
💡 Type /help for commands, or start chatting!

💭 Your question: Hello, what is AI?   ← User types question ONCE
                                       ← System proceeds directly
```

## 🔧 Technical Fix

**File Changed**: `terminal_chat.py`
**Line**: 539

**Code Change**:
```python
# OLD
raw_input = Prompt.ask("\n> ", console=self.console).strip()

# NEW  
raw_input = Prompt.ask("\n💭 [bold cyan]Your question[/bold cyan]", console=self.console).strip()
```

## 🎯 Benefits

### User Experience Improvements
- ✅ **No Duplicate Entry**: Question typed only once
- ✅ **Consistent Styling**: Same prompt format throughout
- ✅ **Clear Intent**: Obvious what user should input
- ✅ **Professional Look**: Emoji + formatting matches overall design

### Mode Consistency
Both Enhanced Mode and Quick Mode now show:
```
💭 Your question: [user input]
```

### Visual Consistency
The prompt now matches the same style used in:
- Enhanced mode customization: `💭 [bold cyan]Your question[/bold cyan]`
- Theme selection prompts
- Context input prompts
- All other user input requests

## 📋 Flow Comparison

### Enhanced Mode Flow (After Fix)

2. User types: `"What is machine learning?"`
3. System shows theme selection (1-9)
4. User selects theme
5. System asks for optional context
6. Response generated with selected theme

### Quick Mode Flow (After Fix)
1. User sees: `💭 Your question:`
2. User types: `"What is machine learning?"`

### Commands Still Work
```
💭 Your question: /help     ← Shows help
💭 Your question: /status   ← Shows provider status  
💭 Your question: /quit     ← Exits chat
```
