## **🔧 Technical Architecture**

### **Code Reuse Strategy**
- ✅ **95% code reuse** between web and mobile through shared library
- ✅ **Unified API layer** handles all backend communication
- ✅ **Consistent conversation history** across all platforms
- ✅ **Shared TypeScript types** ensure type safety

### **Two-Tier Chat Workflow**
1. **User Input**: Question submitted through platform-specific UI
2. **Quick Response**: Fast one-liner answer displayed immediately
3. **Enhancement Option**: User can request detailed response
4. **Theme/Audience Selection**: Modal allows customization
5. **Enhanced Response**: Detailed answer replaces quick response
6. **History Preservation**: All interactions saved with context

### **Platform-Specific Optimizations**
- **Web**: Responsive design, RTL support, SEO optimization
- **Mobile**: Native navigation, keyboard handling, touch interactions
- **Shared**: Axios HTTP client, conversation persistence, error handling
